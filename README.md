# Hospitality_powerbi_project
This is my first data analysis project.
Hello everyone ... I have created this interactive dashboard in #powerbi on hospitality domain.

First of all thanks to codebasics for this amazing amazing resume challenge (In case, just visit code basics , this was their 1st resume challenge). I have really gained a lot of knowledge and techniques, and it was really fun to play with the data.
Also a Biggg thanks to Dhaval Patel Patel sir and Hemanand Vadivel Vadivel sir for your outstanding explanation of each concept and for this amazing platform where all of us can nurture our skills and get ourselves a place in the most interesting field.

Furthermore, my key learnings from this project are:
ðŸŽ¯ Definition and importance of the hospitality domain related terms like ADR, Realization, RevPAR, Occupancy, DSRN, DBRN, DURN, etc.
ðŸŽ¯ Level 1 Analysis: If there is a problem and Level 2 Analysis: which process is having the problem.
ðŸŽ¯ I also learned the method to insert tooltip in dashboard to make the dashboard more interactive.

Revenue insights in hospitality domain :

1. AtliQ Grands noticed a loss in their market share and revenue over a few months.To understand the cause of this loss, they needed a way to analyse this .I created a dashboard in #powerbi using three months of data.

2.With the created dashboard, Revenue team of AtliQ Grands were able to gain insights about their revenue trend . This could help in regaining their revenue and market share by 20% in the next month.

I am really really grateful to people like Dhaval Patel sir and Hemanand Vadivel sir for providing such great quality content and teaching to students like us and also for their selfless contribution in the field of data.


Further, please do give your valuable feedback that would really mean a lot to me.
